# Introduction to secure GraphQL APIs (in AWS)
This repository contains template/boilerplate scripts and resources to be used during the workshop.

Contents:
- Single Page Application
- GraphQL API
- Booking NoSQL (DynamoDB) table
- Rooms SQL (Aurora Serverless) database
- Scripts and templates to get these running in the AWS public cloud

During this workshop, weâ€™ll look into authentication, authorization and the integration with multiple backend data sources.

You will need your own AWS-account and laptop to join.

Requirements:
- AWS account
- Postman
- Python 3.x to run single page application locally

Optional:
- NodeJS to make changes, rebuild and run the Single Page Application locally

## Provisioning
1. Clone repository
2. Execute `provision.sh`:

```bash
bash provision.sh

```
The script might return some errors on the first run, as it tries to clean-up any leftovers from previous executions. It is safe to ignore.

NOTE: Consecutive executions of `provision.sh` will **reset** the environment back to the starting point! **Changes done in the AWS Console will be lost!**.

## Start Single Page Application locally
```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 3000
```
It should then be possible to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Starting point
Only admin can add booking by specifying guest, dates and room.

Test:
- Adding a booking as guest fails

## CHANGE 1
Allow guest to add their own booking, without exposing guest as a parameter.

HOW: new mutation, guest auth, no guest parameter, use $ctx.identity.sub in resolver.

Test:
- Adding a booking as guest succeeds.

Observe:
- Updates are not visible without refresh
- Guest cannot remove bookings

## CHANGE 2
Make guest bookings visible without refresh.

HOW: add new mutation to subscription.

Test:
- Adding a booking as guest succeeds and appears without refresh.

## CHANGE 3
Allow guest to remove their own bookings, without exposing guest as parameter.

HOW: new mutation, guest auth, no guest parameter, use $ctx.identity.sub for *authorization* in resolver.

Test:
- Removing guest booking works
- Removing admin booking does not work

Observe:
- Updates are not visible without refresh (fix by adding new mutation to subscription)

## Clean up
Execute `cleanup.sh`:
```bash
bash cleanup.sh

```
